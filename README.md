# 🏥 Healthcare: Online Appointment & Health Record System

## ✅ Project Overview
This is a **Healthcare Management System** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.  
The system allows patients to book appointments online, view medical history, and receive automated email reminders.  
Doctors can manage schedules, view patient appointments, and issue digital prescriptions.  
All data is stored securely in a MongoDB-based **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Hospitals and clinics often face challenges with manual appointment bookings, paper records, and missed reminders.  
This project aims to digitize appointment booking and health record management, focusing on a small clinic model.  
It is designed as a student-friendly project to learn real-world hospital management workflows.
